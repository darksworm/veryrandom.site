    <strong>NOTICE:</strong> Emotional fitness licenses issued before March 2024 expire on June 30, 2025.
    Renewal requires Form EF-47 and an in-person assessment at your local BEF office. Online

    <h1>Maintaining your emotional fitness is a legal requirement</h1>
    <p class="sub">
      Under the Emotional Accountability Act of 2019, all U.S. residents age 18 and older must
      maintain a valid emotional fitness license. Failure to comply may result in a written warning,
      mandatory counseling, or a $340 fine that we will feel bad about issuing.

      <p>The Bureau of Emotional Fitness (BEF) was established by Executive Order 14027 to ensure
      that all Americans maintain a minimum standard of emotional health. We operate 1,200 field

      working on it. We have been working on it since 2019.</p>

          <h3>Arrive at Your Local BEF Office</h3>
          <p>Bring two forms of ID, your current emotional fitness license (if renewing), and
          Form EF-47 (completed in black ink — blue ink will be accepted but Diane will sigh).
          Take a number. The number will be high. Sit down.</p>

          <p>The questionnaire is 14 pages. Page 6 asks you to "describe your relationship with
          impermanence in three sentences or fewer." Page 11 asks if you have cried in the last
          30 days and, if so, to rate the cry on a scale from "light mist" to "full collapse."
          There is no page 13. This is not an error. We removed it. It was too sad.</p>

          <p>A BEF evaluator will sit across from you at a small desk and ask you how you're
          doing. You must answer honestly. "Fine" is not accepted. "Fine" has not been accepted
          since 2021, when the Bureau determined that 98% of people who said "fine" were not, in
          fact, fine. Your evaluator may or may not make eye contact. This depends on Diane's mood.
          You do not get to choose your evaluator. It is usually Diane.</p>

          <p>Scores range from 0 (emotionally inert) to 100 (suspiciously well-adjusted).
          A score of 55 or above is passing. The national average is 61. Diane's personal
          average score, if she were to take her own assessment, would be — and this is her
          estimate — "maybe a 40 on a good day." She has not been formally assessed. Evaluators
          are exempt. This is a policy she advocated for.</p>

        <h3>Diane Kowalczyk</h3>
        <div class="role">SENIOR EMOTIONAL EVALUATOR · 27 YEARS</div>
        <p>Diane has worked at the Bureau since its inception. Before that, she worked at the
        DMV for 22 years. She describes the transition as "lateral." Diane has assessed over
        14,000 residents. She does not smile during assessments. She says smiling "introduces
        bias." Her colleagues say Diane does not smile during non-assessments either. Diane is
        aware of this feedback. She has filed it.</p>

        <h3>Marcus Webb</h3>

        <p>Marcus joined the Bureau after a career in social work. He is the only evaluator
        who asks follow-up questions. Residents describe him as "surprisingly warm for a
        government employee." Diane considers Marcus "enthusiastic," which in Diane's vocabulary
        is neither a compliment nor an insult. Marcus scored a 78 on his own assessment. He told
        Diane. She said "okay."</p>

        <p>Priya teaches the 6-week mandatory emotional fitness course for residents who score
        below 55. The course includes journaling, breathing exercises, and a group discussion
        that Priya describes as "challenging" and the participants describe as "like jury duty
        but for your feelings." Priya's course has a 72% pass rate. The 28% who fail are
        required to take it again. One man has taken it four times. Priya knows him by name.

        Master's in Public Administration and a "complicated relationship with optimism." She
        visits field offices quarterly and asks staff how they're doing. Diane once answered

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 1 ? null : 1">
      <h3>Why is emotional fitness a legal requirement?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 1">The Emotional Accountability Act of 2019 was passed after a
      congressional study found that 74% of Americans described their emotional state as "I don't
      know, fine I guess." Congress determined this was insufficient. The Act requires all adults
      to demonstrate a baseline level of emotional awareness. The vote was 51-49. The dissenting
      senators described themselves as "fine."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 2 ? null : 2">
      <h3>Can I take the assessment online?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 2">No. The Bureau briefly offered online assessments in 2022.
      Within three weeks, 40,000 residents submitted questionnaires that were, in Diane's words,
      "clearly not honest." One resident described their relationship with impermanence as "lol."
      The online portal was shut down. Gerald in IT was supposed to archive the data. Gerald left.
      The data is on Gerald's laptop. We do not know where Gerald is.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 3 ? null : 3">
      <h3>What happens if I fail?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 3">Residents who score below 55 are enrolled in a mandatory 6-week
      remedial course taught by Priya Nair. The course meets Tuesday evenings from 6:30 to 8:00 PM
      in Room 4B of your local BEF office. There is homework. The homework is journaling. Priya
      reads every journal entry. She says this is "the hardest part of her job, but also the most
      important." Dennis from Cleveland has submitted 412 journal entries across four course cycles.
      Priya has read all of them. She says Dennis is "making progress." Dennis disagrees.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 4 ? null : 4">
      <h3>Can I appeal my score?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 4">Yes. File Form EF-12 within 30 days of your assessment. Appeals
      are reviewed by a senior evaluator, which at every field office in the country is Diane.
      Diane has received 847 appeals in five years. She has approved three. The three successful
      appeals were all cases where, in Diane's assessment, "the resident was having a genuinely
      bad day and the score did not reflect their typical emotional state." When asked how she
      determines this, Diane said: "I know." She did not elaborate.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 5 ? null : 5">
      <h3>Is the staff emotionally fit?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 5">Bureau evaluators are exempt from assessment under Section 4(c)
      of the Emotional Accountability Act. This exemption was proposed by Diane in 2020 and
      approved unanimously. Director Hollowell has suggested "voluntary staff assessments" twice.
      Both times, Diane looked at her. Both times, the suggestion was withdrawn. Marcus once
      voluntarily shared his score of 78 during a staff meeting. The room was silent. Diane
      said "okay." The topic has not been raised since.</p>

      <h3>Visit Your Local BEF Office</h3>
      <p><strong>Hours:</strong> Monday–Friday, 8:00 AM – 4:30 PM. Closed federal holidays and
      the third Wednesday of each month, which Diane has designated as "administrative recovery."
      Nobody has asked what she is recovering from.</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0.4rem;"><strong>What to bring:</strong> Two forms of ID, completed Form EF-47 (black ink),
      your current license (if renewing), and "an openness to being honest with yourself for
      possibly the first time" (Priya's suggestion — now printed on the door).</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 0.4rem;"><strong>Average wait time:</strong> 2 hours 14 minutes. This is an improvement
      from 2021 (3 hours 40 minutes). Diane has said "you're welcome" about this once, to no one
