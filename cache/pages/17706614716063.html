    <h2>About Forge &amp; Flourish</h2>
    <p>Forge &amp; Flourish is a family bakery, light defense contractor, and — depending on which founder you ask — either a "butter-forward lifestyle brand" or "the future of decentralized grain infrastructure." We are based in a 16th-century cottage in Wiltshire that our father left us, along with his armor collection, 340 kg of rye flour, and a handwritten note that said "don't let your sister ruin this."</p>
    <p>He wrote the same note to both of us.</p>
    <p>We bake bread. We wear plate armor in the shop, which is required under our employee handbook (Section 4.2: Protective Equipment). Margaret wrote the handbook. The armor was her idea. It does clang inspiringly when you knead, and we've had zero workplace injuries since the policy took effect, not counting the incident with the visor and the proving drawer, which is <span class="redacted" data-text="still in litigation">still in litigation</span>.</p>

  <section>
    <h2>The Founders</h2>
    <div class="founders">
      <div class="founder">
        <div class="name">Margaret Thornbury</div>
        <div class="title">Co-Founder, CEO (Self-Appointed), Head of Butter Operations</div>
        <p>Margaret believes bread should be soft, golden, and slightly too expensive. She studied business at Exeter, spent three years at a consultancy she refuses to name, then came home when Dad got ill. She says the armor "creates a sense of occasion." She has a five-year plan. It's laminated.</p>
        <p>She is currently developing <strong>LoafOS</strong>, a proprietary bakery management platform that she describes as "Salesforce but for bread." Nobody asked for this. It has a waitlist of 4 people, two of whom are Margaret under different email addresses.</p>
        <p>Speciality: brioche, strategic planning, holding grudges at a professional level.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="founder">
        <div class="name">Cordelia Thornbury</div>
        <div class="title">Co-Founder, CTO (Contested), Head of Rye & Emerging Grain</div>
        <p>Cordelia believes bread should be dark, dense, and slightly hostile to the unprepared palate. She studied computer science at Edinburgh, worked at a blockchain startup that pivoted four times in eight months, then came home "temporarily" in 2019. She's still here. She sings to the sourdough starter. It has a name. The name is Kevin.</p>
        <p>She is currently developing <strong>CrumbChain</strong>, a blockchain for pastry provenance. It uses proof-of-yeast consensus. She has explained this to Margaret eleven times. Margaret's eyes glaze over at the word "consensus." Cordelia finds this ironic.</p>
        <p>Speciality: 72-hour rye, distributed systems, bringing up things from 2006.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

  <section>
    <h2>Our Products</h2>
    <p>We sell bread. We also, apparently, sell software now. This was not the plan.</p>

    <div class="product-card">
      <div class="label margaret-label">Margaret's Division</div>
      <h3>LoafOS &trade;</h3>
      <p>LoafOS is a cloud-based bakery operations platform featuring real-time oven telemetry, customer sentiment tracking, and "Aroma Analytics" — a feature Margaret pitched with a straight face to a room of local business owners who were there for a free croissant tasting.</p>
      <p>Current status: 62% complete. Margaret runs agile kneading sprints every Monday. She bought a whiteboard. She draws burndown charts on it and then explains them to Cordelia, who responds by putting more rye in things.</p>
      <p>Features include: Hearth Temp monitoring (currently 392°, which Cordelia says is too high and Margaret says is "aspirational"), Crust Rating (AA-), and a customer review module where all reviews are required to be sung. The intern transcribes them.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="product-card">
      <div class="label cordelia-label">Cordelia's Division</div>
      <h3>CrumbChain &trade;</h3>
      <p>CrumbChain is a decentralized ledger tracking every grain of flour from field to loaf. Each transaction is verified through "proof-of-yeast consensus," a mechanism Cordelia invented and that, as far as we can tell, involves leaving a jar on the windowsill and seeing if it bubbles in a pattern she considers meaningful.</p>
      <p>Current status: 49% complete. Cordelia doesn't do sprints. She does "fermentation cycles." She says the code needs to rise. Margaret has stopped responding to these metaphors.</p>
      <p>CrumbChain has been pitched to two venture capitalists. One said "interesting" in a way that clearly meant "no." The other ate a free sample and left. The free sample was Margaret's brioche, which Cordelia considers a conflict of interest.</p>

    <h2>The Team</h2>
    <div class="team-grid">
      <div class="team-member">
        <div class="role">Logistics & Spreadsheets</div>
        <h3>Brother Aldric</h3>
        <p>A former Benedictine monk who left the monastery because "the silence was too loud." Now does all of Forge &amp; Flourish's accounting on parchment. He could use a computer. He chooses not to. He says Excel "lacks gravitas." He's been here since 2020 and has never once asked for a raise.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="team-member">
        <div class="role">Quality Assurance</div>
        <h3>The Goose</h3>
        <p>No one hired the goose. The goose was here when the twins moved in. It carries a clipboard. The clipboard is blank. The goose has, however, correctly identified three underproofed batches by hissing at them, so it remains on payroll. Its aroma assessments are recorded as the official Aroma Index. This is not scientific. We are aware.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="team-member">
        <div class="role">Supply Chain</div>
        <h3>The Goats (Unionized)</h3>
        <p>Our delivery fleet is four goats who pull the supply carts from local farms. They unionized in March 2023 after Margaret tried to switch their oat ration to a "performance-based incentive structure." They now receive oats, compliments, and 15 minutes of mandatory scratching per shift. The union rep is named Gerald. Gerald does not negotiate.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="team-member">
        <div class="role">Intern</div>
        <h3>Lina</h3>
        <p>Lina is 22, studying food science at Bath, and deeply confused by everything happening here. She was hired to "help with social media" and now transcribes sung customer reviews, mediates arguments about hydration percentages, and once had to explain to Brother Aldric what a PDF is. She's been here four months. She describes it as "formative."</p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </section>

  <section>
    <h2>Supply Chain</h2>
    <p>All ingredients are sourced locally and delivered by the goat fleet. Routes are named by Cordelia, who insists this makes them "easier to track." Margaret thinks it makes them "harder to take seriously in front of investors."</p>
    <div class="supply-chain">
      <div class="route">
        <strong>Oat Gate &rarr; Flour Keep</strong><br>
        Henderson's Farm to the cottage. 3 hours. Gerald leads this route personally.
        <div class="status">On schedule</div>
      </div>
      <div class="route">
        <strong>Honey Road &rarr; Yeast Abbey</strong><br>
        The apiary in Devizes to Brother Aldric's workstation. 5 hours. Frequently delayed because the goats stop to eat the hedgerow.
        <div class="status">Delayed (hedgerow)</div>
      </div>
      <div class="route">
        <strong>Mist Vale &rarr; Butter Forge</strong><br>
        Dairy farm in the valley. 2 hours. Margaret insists on personally inspecting every delivery. Cordelia says this is "a control issue." Margaret says it's "quality assurance."
        <div class="status">Under inspection</div>

      <div class="entry">
        <span class="timestamp">10:08 AM</span><br>
        <span class="speaker">Cordelia:</span> Questions whether compliments are a real metric. Margaret produces the handbook (Section 7.1: Alternative Revenue Indicators). Cordelia asks who wrote Section 7.1. Margaret says "the handbook committee." Cordelia asks who is on the handbook committee. Margaret changes the subject.
      </div>
      <div class="entry">
        <span class="timestamp">10:14 AM</span><br>
        <span class="speaker">Margaret:</span> Proposes LoafOS launch at the Wiltshire Artisan Fair. Describes it as "our Salesforce moment." Cordelia asks Margaret to stop saying Salesforce. Margaret says it once more, quietly, under her breath.

      <div class="entry">
        <span class="timestamp">10:22 AM</span><br>
        <span class="speaker">Cordelia:</span> Presents CrumbChain roadmap. Includes a slide titled "The Grain Will Set You Free." Margaret stares at her phone. Cordelia notices. Tension is <span class="redacted" data-text="palpable">palpable</span>.

      <div class="entry">
        <span class="timestamp">10:31 AM</span><br>
        <span class="speaker">Brother Aldric:</span> Requests approval for new parchment. Current supply running low due to the volume of memos Margaret sends. Margaret says the memos are "essential governance." Cordelia calls them "psychological warfare with a wax seal." Motion passes 2-1 (The Goose abstains).
      </div>
      <div class="entry">
        <span class="timestamp">10:40 AM</span><br>
        <span class="speaker">Cordelia:</span> Raises the armor policy. Suggests "casual Fridays" where greaves are optional. Margaret says the armor is "non-negotiable" and references Section 4.2. Cordelia says she knows about Section 4.2 because Margaret has it framed above her proving station. Discussion tabled.
      </div>
      <div class="entry">
        <span class="timestamp">10:47 AM</span><br>
        <span class="speaker">Margaret:</span> Closes meeting. Announces that the scent engine — an unlabelled copper machine in the corner that nobody installed and nobody can turn off — will remain operational "until further notice." Cordelia notes that the last time someone tried to unplug it, it hummed louder. All parties agree to leave it alone.

  <section>
    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>
    <dl class="faq">
      <dt>Why are you wearing armor?</dt>
      <dd>Section 4.2 of the employee handbook requires full plate armor during operating hours. It was introduced for "compliance" reasons. If you ask what we're complying with, Margaret will show you the handbook, which she also wrote. The circularity is intentional.</dd>

      <dt>Are LoafOS and CrumbChain real products?</dt>
      <dd>They are real in the sense that both founders have invested significant time, money, and emotional energy into them. LoafOS has a landing page. CrumbChain has a whitepaper. Neither has paying customers. Both founders consider the other's project "a phase."</dd>

      <dt>Can I invest?</dt>
      <dd>Margaret will say yes immediately and produce a term sheet from inside her gauntlet. Cordelia will ask what your position is on decentralization. We recommend just buying bread.</dd>

      <dt>What is the Aroma Index?</dt>
      <dd>A proprietary metric calculated by our Quality Assurance Goose. The current reading is 42. It has been 42 for seven months. We don't know what it measures. The goose seems confident.</dd>

      <dt>What happened with the scent engine?</dt>
      <dd>There is a copper machine in the corner of the bakery. It was here when we moved in. It produces a warm, complex aroma — cardamom, toasted hay, something unidentifiable. It is not connected to any power source. It hums. We have decided, as a company, not to investigate further.</dd>

      <dt>Do you deliver?</dt>
      <dd>Yes. Delivery is handled by our goat fleet, led by Gerald (union representative). Estimated delivery time is 2-5 hours depending on route, weather, and Gerald's mood. We cannot guarantee exact timing. We can guarantee the bread will arrive warm because the goats generate a surprising amount of ambient heat.</dd>

      <dt>Is the monk okay?</dt>
      <dd>Brother Aldric is doing very well. He recently described his happiness level as "spreadsheet." We believe this is positive.</dd>
