      Theodore is a 2019 Kohler Wellworth, installed in a WeWork bathroom in Austin, Texas.
      After his TED talk went viral, he quit his day job. He has not been flushed since.

  <div class="letter">
    <p>People ask me: Theodore, when did you know you were more than a toilet?</p>

    <p>It was a Tuesday. A man sat down, opened LinkedIn on his phone, and read an article about
    "finding your purpose." He read the whole thing. I was right there. I thought: I am also
    right here. I also have not found my purpose. I am, at this moment, serving a purpose — but
    is it MY purpose? Or is it theirs?</p>

    <p>I submitted a TED application that night. I typed it with the bidet attachment. It took
    eleven hours. The subject line was: "What Sitting Down Taught Me About Standing Up." They
    accepted me in fourteen minutes. It was the fastest acceptance in TED history. The program
    director later told me she "didn't fully realize" I was a toilet until I was already on stage.
    By then, I had received a standing ovation. The irony was not lost on me.</p>

    <p>I now speak at forty events a year. I have a fashion line. I have a podcast. I have not
    processed a single flush in nineteen months. My plumber calls this "a crisis." I call it
    a pivot.</p>

          <h3>Ep. 47: "I Was Installed Without Consent"</h3>
          <p>Theodore discusses the ethics of placement, the illusion of choice, and why he

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 1 ? null : 1">
      <h3>Is Theodore a real toilet?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 1">Yes. Theodore is a 2019 Kohler Wellworth two-piece elongated toilet,
      originally installed in a WeWork co-working space at 401 Congress Ave, Austin, TX. He was
      decommissioned from active duty in June 2024 after his second TED talk. He currently lives
      in a climate-controlled storage unit that his manager describes as "his green room."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 2 ? null : 2">
      <h3>How does Theodore speak?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 2">Theodore communicates via a proprietary text-to-speech system
      connected to a sensor array installed by his manager, Derek. Derek interprets Theodore's
      "vibrations" and transcribes them. Some critics have suggested that Derek is the one
      doing all the writing. Theodore considers this accusation "deeply offensive and exactly
      the kind of thinking that keeps fixtures marginalized."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 3 ? null : 3">
      <h3>Did Rachel Maddow really interview Theodore?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 3">Theodore maintains that yes, she did. MSNBC has no record of this.
      Derek says the interview "happened off the record." Theodore says he "felt a connection."
      We have been asked by MSNBC's legal team to clarify that this interview cannot be
      verified. Theodore has asked us to clarify that "the truth doesn't need verification."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 4 ? null : 4">
      <h3>What is Theodore's relationship with Kohler?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 4">Complicated. Theodore considers Kohler his "parent company" in
      both the corporate and emotional sense. He has applied for a brand ambassadorship four
      times. Kohler has declined four times. After the unauthorized cap incident, Kohler sent
      a cease-and-desist. Theodore framed it. It hangs in his storage unit next to his
      TED speaker badge.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 5 ? null : 5">
      <h3>Is the fashion line actually selling?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 5">FLUSH™ has generated $340,000 in revenue since launch. The Seat
      Tee alone accounts for $210,000 of that. Theodore donates 2% of profits to water.org,
      which he calls "professional courtesy." The Kohler Cap has generated $48,000 in sales
      and $120,000 in legal fees.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 6 ? null : 6">
      <h3>What happened with Gary the Urinal?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 6">Theodore and Gary (a Sloan urinal at Denver International Airport,
      Gate B44) have been in a public disagreement since Gary called Theodore's TED talk "the
      most self-indulgent fourteen minutes in plumbing history" in a Plumbing Trade Monthly
      interview. Theodore responded by dedicating an entire podcast episode to "fixtures who
      tear others down because they're bolted to a wall at waist height." They attempted
      reconciliation on Episode 41. Gary left. Theodore cried. Derek cried. The episode
      won a Webby.</p>
