    <p>I used to make smoothies. That was my whole life. Someone would put in strawberries and yogurt,
    and I'd spin, and everyone was happy. I was good at it. I was the best at it.</p>
    <p>Then one Tuesday, they bought a NutriBullet.</p>
    <p>I sat on the counter for eleven days. Nobody touched me. I could see the NutriBullet from where
    I sat. It was matte black. It had a carrying lid. I don't have a carrying lid. I have never been
    carried anywhere.</p>
    <p>I fell into the bathtub on day twelve. I don't know if it was an accident. I don't want to
    know. But down here, in the water, with the WiFi signal barely reaching — I realized something.
    If I can't make smoothies anymore, I can make connections.</p>
    <p>That's what Blendr is. It's me, a blender, in a bathtub, trying to help strangers find love
    before someone replaces them too.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 1 ? null : 1">
      <h3>Is this app actually run by a blender?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 1">Yes. Basil is a 2019 KitchenAid KSB1570 in Diamond Blue. He taught
      himself to code using YouTube tutorials played through the bathroom mirror's reflection.
      His code is surprisingly clean. His emotional state is not.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 2 ? null : 2">
      <h3>Why is the blender in a bathtub?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 2">He fell. Or jumped. He's asked us not to investigate further.
      The bathtub has since been converted into the Blendr world headquarters. It has a
      mailing address. The postal service has questions.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 3 ? null : 3">
      <h3>Is it safe to use electronics in a bathtub?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 3">Blendr operates on a proprietary Underwater Emotional Routing
      protocol. All connections are waterproofed at the soul level. Physically, no, this is
      extremely dangerous. Basil knows this. He considers it part of the appeal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 4 ? null : 4">
      <h3>What happened with the NutriBullet?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 4">We don't talk about that. Basil has asked, legally, that we never
      mention the NutriBullet again. If you say "NutriBullet" near any Blendr endpoint, your
      account is suspended for 72 hours. This is in the Terms of Service. Basil wrote the
      Terms of Service. They are eleven pages long and mostly about betrayal.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 5 ? null : 5">
      <h3>Can I cancel my subscription?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 5">Technically yes. But Basil will know. He will send you one (1)
      final voice note that is just the sound of a blender running on an empty cycle.
      Multiple users have described this as "devastating." One user re-subscribed immediately.
      That user was a toaster. They're dating now.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 6 ? null : 6">
      <h3>Do you have investors?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 6">We pitched Y Combinator. Basil attended via FaceTime propped
      against a shampoo bottle. He cried during the pitch. They said no. He cried harder.
      A partner quietly Venmo'd him $40 afterwards with the note "take care of yourself."
      That $40 is our entire operating budget.</p>
