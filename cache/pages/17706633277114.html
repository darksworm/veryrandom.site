    <h1>Favor Bank &amp; the Building That Wouldn’t Sit Still</h1>
    <p class="lead">
      We opened a bank that trades in favors. We made a social network out of it. We did it all through interpretive dance.
      Then the building learned how to move. I should have known: the foundation was poured in the shape of a compass.
    </p>
    <p class="nav-note">Scroll. Tap. Hover. The academy prefers choreography to navigation.</p>

      <h2>Beginning: The Branch That Wore Comets</h2>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          The original branch of Favor Bank glowed like a disco ball that had read too much mythology. It sat on Fourth Avenue
          Monday through Thursday. On Fridays, it <span class="hover-reveal" tabindex="0">orbited the park<span>
          We called these “interest walks.” If the building moved, your debts moved with it. Some people found this reassuring.
          Others wore roller skates.</span></span>.
        </p>
        <p>
          Our social network wasn’t a feed; it was a floor. You owed a neighbor three hours of plant-sitting? You performed
          an apology in seven counts. Needed a ride to the airport? You learned “The Spiral of Gratitude,” arms like swans
          steering a silent taxi.
        </p>
        <p>
          The tellers called themselves “choreographers.” The vault was a stage. The currency was memory, and the ATM
          printed receipts on paper that smelled like summer rain.
        </p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section class="reveal">
      <h3>Excerpt: The Welcome Packet</h3>
      <div class="letter">
        <p><strong>Dear Account Holder,</strong></p>
        <p>
          You are now enrolled in the Favor Bank Social Ballet. Your first deposit is a favor owed by a stranger in a trench coat
          who once carried your groceries up six flights. Do not try to repay the coat directly; we’ll see it in rehearsal.
        </p>
        <p>
          To send a message, select a movement from the Lexicon of Gentle Gestures. “Wrist flick + shoulder sway” means
          “I can water your plants.” “Elbow arc + heel tap” means “Please stop borrowing my vintage toaster.”
        </p>
        <p>
          If the building is not at the listed address, check the sky. We publish our coordinates in constellation form.

        <p>Respectfully, The Academy of Astral Finance</p>

      <h2>Middle: The Network Learns to Gossip in Pirouettes</h2>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          Once the dances spread, the city responded. A salsa rumor arrived before the breakfast bagels. A waltz of concern
          spun through the subway: “The building has developed a crush on the moon.”
        </p>
        <div class="timeline">
          <div class="timeline-item">Week 3: A proposal performed entirely in toe-taps. The ring is a favor.</div>
          <div class="timeline-item">Week 7: The first user complaint about “lag.” The choreographers add more jazz hands.</div>
          <div class="timeline-item">Week 11: The building attempts a backflip. We vote no, unanimously.</div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Eventually, the Bank introduced “favors-as-threads.” Each thread began with a dance and ended with a debt repaid.
          Our most viral thread was a grandmother’s hip-swayed tutorial: how to make soup for someone you haven’t forgiven yet.

      <h2>End: The Favor That Finally Lands</h2>
      <div class="panel">
        <p>
          At dusk, the academy threw its final gathering. We wore gold shoes and purple coats. The building hovered
          just above the pavement like a question mark in a good mood.
        </p>
        <p>
          The biggest favor was a simple one: stay. So we danced a “home” into the air. The structure floated, exhaled,
          and gently set itself down. The city clapped. The network sighed. We all agreed that a building that knows how
          to move also knows when to rest.
        </p>
        <p class="endcap">
          And when you need to say thank you, you can still find us — somewhere between Fourth Avenue and the stars.
