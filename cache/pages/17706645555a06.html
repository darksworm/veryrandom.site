    <h1>Your public library is now an <em>amusement park</em> after 9 PM</h1>
    <p class="sub">
      By order of Head Librarian Gladys Fernwhistle, the District 9 Central Branch
      converts nightly into a fully operational theme park. The city council was not consulted.
      The city council has been informed.
    </p>
    <div class="notice">CURRENT STATUS: OPEN — 14 rides operational, 2 under investigation</div>
  </div>

  <div class="letter">
    <p>I have been a librarian for 31 years. In that time I have watched our annual budget
    get cut seventeen times. Last March they took the beanbags. The beanbags, which the
    children loved. Which I loved.</p>

    <p>I decided that if the city would not fund the library, the library would fund itself.
    On April 4th, after the last patron left, I began construction on the Dewey Decimal
    Drop — a 40-foot log flume that runs through the non-fiction wing. I used lumber from
    the decommissioned magazine racks. The water is from the drinking fountain on level 2,
    which has always had too much pressure anyway.</p>

    <p>By June we had seven rides, a gift shop in the returns office, and a cotton candy machine
    where the microfiche used to be. Revenue exceeded the library's annual budget in eleven days.
    The mayor called. I did not answer. He called again. I sent him a library card application.</p>

    <p>This is a public service.</p>

    <h2>Current Attractions</h2>
    <div class="rides">
      <div class="ride">
        <h3>The Dewey Decimal Drop</h3>
        <p>40-foot log flume through non-fiction. Riders are sorted by subject on the way down. Last week someone landed in Geology. They were looking for Romance.</p>
        <span class="status status-open">OPERATIONAL</span>
      </div>
      <div class="ride">
        <h3>Periodical Plunge</h3>
        <p>Spinning teacups made from repurposed magazine bins. Each cup has a different decade. The 1970s cup smells like it. We can't fix that.</p>
        <span class="status status-open">OPERATIONAL</span>
      </div>
      <div class="ride">
        <h3>The Quiet Zone</h3>
        <p>A haunted house in the reference section. Jump scares include: overdue notices, a librarian saying "shh" directly into your ear, and a realistic simulation of finding a spider in a book.</p>
        <span class="status status-open">OPERATIONAL</span>
      </div>
      <div class="ride">
        <h3>Catalog Carousel</h3>
        <p>Rideable brass animals, each representing a genre. The mystery horse goes slightly faster than the others and nobody knows why. We've stopped investigating.</p>
        <span class="status status-open">OPERATIONAL</span>
      </div>
      <div class="ride">
        <h3>Microfiche Mountain</h3>
        <p>Indoor roller coaster built from the old card catalog infrastructure. Top speed: 34 mph. Minimum height: 4'2". Maximum overdue fines: $200 (safety reasons).</p>
        <span class="status status-closed">CLOSED — STRUCTURAL REVIEW</span>
      </div>
      <div class="ride">
        <h3>The Late Return</h3>
        <p>A drop tower. You sit in an oversized book return slot and fall three stories into a foam pit that smells like old paperbacks. It is the most popular ride. Gladys is proud of this one.</p>

          <strong>Catalog Carousel — Horse Incident</strong>
          <p>The mystery horse achieved speeds inconsistent with its gearing. Rider was unharmed but finished an entire novel during what should have been a 3-minute ride. Investigation inconclusive. Horse has been spoken to.</p>

          <p>A haunted house patron screamed at 94 decibels, disturbing a man who was trying to sleep in Large Print. Gladys issued a formal apology and a $2 gift shop credit. The man was later found to not have a library card. He was escorted out.</p>

          <p>A patron's glasses fell into the foam pit and were not recovered for six days. During extraction, staff found: 14 phones, a wedding ring, $847 in loose change, and a first edition of <em>The Great Gatsby</em> that had been missing from circulation since 2003. Ride closed pending foam audit. Gladys cried. She thought the Gatsby was gone forever.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 1 ? null : 1">
      <h3>Is this legal?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 1">Gladys has consulted the library's copy of <em>Municipal Law for Beginners</em> (1987 edition, slightly water damaged) and has determined that nothing in the District 9 charter explicitly prohibits a log flume in the non-fiction wing. The city attorney has sent four letters. Gladys has filed them in the returns bin.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 2 ? null : 2">
      <h3>Does the library still function as a library?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 2">Yes. Daytime hours (9 AM – 8:45 PM) are normal library operations. At 8:45 PM, Gladys plays a specific playlist over the PA system and the transformation begins. The entire process takes 14 minutes. She has it down to a science. The Dewey Decimal Drop is hidden behind a false wall of encyclopedias. The carousel folds into the floor. The cotton candy machine is always visible. Gladys says it "brings comfort during business hours."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 3 ? null : 3">
      <h3>What happened to the beanbags?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 3">They were removed by the city on March 14th as part of budget cuts. Gladys does not discuss this. If you mention the beanbags, your visit is over. She will refund your admission in full and walk you to the exit in silence. One patron tried to bring their own beanbag. Gladys confiscated it. It is now part of the foam pit.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 4 ? null : 4">
      <h3>Can I host a birthday party here?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 4">Yes. Parties include: unlimited rides, a cake baked by Gladys (she only makes carrot cake, this is not negotiable), a dramatic reading of the birthday child's favorite book performed by Gladys in full costume, and a library card if the child doesn't already have one. If the child already has a library card, Gladys will cry. She says it's pride.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 5 ? null : 5">
      <h3>Has the mayor been here?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 5">The mayor visited on February 10th with the stated intent of "shutting this down." He stayed for four hours. He was seen on the Periodical Plunge three times. His office released a statement calling the park "under review." Gladys sent him a thank-you card and a copy of <em>Leadership for Dummies</em>. He has not responded.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 6 ? null : 6">
      <h3>What does the city council think?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 6">The city council held an emergency session on April 2nd. The vote to close the park was 4-3. Gladys attended the meeting. She brought cotton candy for all seven council members. The vote was re-taken. It was 3-4. The park remains open. Gladys does not consider this bribery. She considers it "community engagement."</p>
