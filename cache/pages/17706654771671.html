  <div class="letter">
    <p>I started WhiskerWire because nobody was asking the hard questions. A glass falls off
    the counter at 3 AM and the humans just say "oh, the cat." The cat? Which cat? Based on what
    evidence? Where is the forensic analysis? Where is the timeline? Where is the accountability?</p>

    <p>I am a journalist. I was born in a shelter, which is basically the same as growing up on
    the streets. I spent my first year batting at a feather toy in what the humans call a
    "living room" but what I call a beat. I know every corner of this house. I know which floorboard
    creaks at 2 AM. I know which cabinet doesn't close all the way. I know that the other cat —
    Beans — was on the kitchen counter at 3:44 AM on the night of the glass incident. I know this
    because I was watching. I am always watching.</p>

    <p>The humans don't read our reports. The goldfish funds us anyway. She says transparency
    doesn't require an audience. I don't fully understand her but I respect her commitment.
    She has a very small bowl and a very large vision.</p>

        <h3>Glass Found Shattered on Kitchen Floor; Beans "Has No Comment"</h3>
        <p>A 12-oz water glass was discovered on the kitchen floor at approximately 3:47 AM.
        The humans blamed "the wind," despite all windows being closed. WhiskerWire's forensic
        team has identified paw prints consistent with a 14-lb domestic shorthair matching Beans'
        weight class. Beans was reached for comment through the cat door and stated only "meow,"
        which our legal team is reviewing for possible obstruction. The glass was from IKEA. It
        has not been replaced. The humans seem fine with this.</p>

        <h3>Red Dot Appears for Third Consecutive Evening; Source Remains Unidentified</h3>
        <p>For the third night in a row, an unidentified red dot appeared on the living room wall
        at approximately 8:15 PM. WhiskerWire correspondent Nimbus pursued the dot for eleven
        minutes before it vanished near the bookshelf. Investigators noted that the male human was
        "smiling" during the incident and holding an unidentified cylindrical object. The dot has
        no known origin, no physical form, and no apparent motive. Nimbus has filed the case
        under "Unexplained Phenomena" but privately told WhiskerWire he "knows it's something"
        and "won't stop until he catches it." This is his ninth report on the dot. He has never
        caught it.</p>

        <h3>Opinion: The 3 PM Sunbeam Belongs to Everyone</h3>
        <p>The 3 PM sunbeam on the living room carpet is approximately 18 inches wide and lasts
        for 43 minutes. It is, by any measure, the most valuable piece of real estate in this
        house. And yet, for the past six weeks, Beans has claimed it exclusively, arriving at
        2:54 PM and stretching to maximum width. This is not equitable. This paper has reviewed the
        household charter (there is no household charter — this is part of the problem) and
        found no legal basis for Beans' occupation. We call on all residents to support a fair
        sunbeam rotation schedule. Beans has been notified. Beans is asleep in the sunbeam.</p>

        <h3>The Disappearance of the Grey Mouse Toy (2022–Present)</h3>
        <p>On or around September 14, 2022, a grey felt mouse with a rattle inside disappeared
        from the area beneath the refrigerator. The mouse had been in continuous custody under
        the fridge for approximately eight months. WhiskerWire has conducted 14 sweeps of the
        kitchen. The mouse has not been recovered. The humans purchased a replacement in October
        2022, which Soot has described as "an insult." The replacement is orange. The original
        was grey. "They are not the same mouse," Soot wrote in a 2,000-word investigative piece
        that the humans did not read. The case remains open. Soot checks under the fridge daily.</p>

    <h2>About WhiskerWire</h2>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 1 ? null : 1">
      <h3>How is WhiskerWire funded?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 1">WhiskerWire is entirely funded by Marina Goldfin, a goldfish who
      lives on the kitchen counter. The source of Marina's wealth is unknown. Soot has
      investigated this twice and both times concluded that "some questions are bigger than
      journalism." Marina's bowl was purchased at PetSmart for $11.99. Her editorial budget is,
      by Soot's estimate, "unlimited." She has never denied a funding request. She has also
      never confirmed one. She swims in circles. The circles are enough.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 2 ? null : 2">
      <h3>Do the humans know about WhiskerWire?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 2">No. The humans believe the cats "just sit around all day." This
      is incorrect. Soot runs a four-cat newsroom. Nimbus files daily field reports. Beans
      writes a column. The operation broadcasts from behind the sofa using equipment that
      Soot will not describe in detail for security reasons, except to say that it involves
      "a phone the humans think they lost in 2023." The humans occasionally hear noises at
      3 AM and assume it is "the heater." It is not the heater. It is The Night Desk.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 3 ? null : 3">
      <h3>Is Beans really guilty?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 3">WhiskerWire maintains editorial independence and does not
      pre-judge any subject of investigation. That said, Soot would like it noted that Beans
      has been implicated in 73% of all investigated incidents, has never provided a credible
      alibi, and was found "at the scene" of the glass incident with what Soot described as
      "a look of complete indifference, which is worse than guilt." Beans' column remains
      on the WhiskerWire schedule because Marina swam left when asked.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 4 ? null : 4">
      <h3>Has WhiskerWire ever been wrong?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 4">Once. In March 2024, WhiskerWire reported that a sock found under
      the bed was "evidence of human negligence." It was later determined to be Nimbus' sock.
      Nimbus had been sleeping on it. Soot issued a full retraction and a personal apology
      to the humans, which he delivered by sitting near the sock and blinking slowly. The
      humans did not understand the apology. They moved the sock. Soot considers the matter
      closed but "not forgotten."</p>
