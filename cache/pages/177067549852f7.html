  <div class="letter">
    <p>In 2019, my brother forgot our mother's birthday. Not in a small way. In a way that involved
    a cruise ship, a time zone miscalculation, and a voicemail that began with "Happy Thursday."
    Her birthday is on a Saturday. Her name is not Thursday.</p>

    <p>My brother asked me to call her. I said no. He asked me to text her on his behalf. I said no.
    Then he said, "What if you just... went over there and said sorry? Like, really said it. Like
    you meant it." And I did. I drove forty minutes to her house in Edison, New Jersey. I wore
    my good suit. I brought flowers — not gas station flowers, real flowers from an actual florist,
    $44. I sat at her kitchen table and I apologized for my brother with more sincerity than my
    brother has expressed about anything in his entire life.</p>

    <p>She cried. She forgave him. She made me a sandwich. I ate the sandwich. On the drive home I
    thought: I am better at being sorry than most people are at anything.</p>

    <p>I quit my job at Deloitte the next Monday. I have not looked back. I have, however, looked
    down — at my shoes, contritely, over two thousand times since then. It is part of the method.</p>

  <section id="services">
    <h2>Services & Pricing</h2>
    <p style="color: var(--muted); margin-bottom: 1.2rem;">All apologies are delivered in person,
    in the suit. Gerald does not apologize via text, email, or phone. "An apology you can't see
    is just words," Gerald says. "Anyone can do words."</p>
    <div class="services">
      <div class="service">
        <h3>Standard Apology</h3>
        <div class="price">$350</div>
        <p>One in-person apology, up to 15 minutes. Includes eye contact, one
        meaningful pause, and a firm-but-gentle handshake. Flowers not included
        but strongly recommended (Gerald will select them — $44 add-on).</p>
      </div>
      <div class="service">
        <h3>The Full Gerald</h3>
        <div class="price">$800</div>
        <p>Up to 45 minutes. Includes the apology, a brief explanation of what went wrong
        (Gerald will make it sound better than it was), sustained eye contact through
        the difficult part, and one (1) controlled tear. The tear is real. Gerald can
        cry on command. He considers this his greatest skill and his deepest burden.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="service">
        <h3>The Wedding Package</h3>
        <div class="price">$2,200</div>
        <p>For when you did something at the wedding. Gerald arrives in a nicer suit (he has
        two suits — the regular and the wedding). Includes apologies to up to six (6) parties,
        a toast rewrite, and a slow dance with whoever is most upset. Gerald is an adequate
        dancer. He has been told this twice.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="service">
        <h3>Corporate Atonement</h3>
        <div class="price">$5,000 <small>+ travel</small></div>
        <p>For businesses that did something and the PR team's apology made it worse.
        Gerald arrives at the all-hands meeting. He stands at the front. He does not
        use slides. He makes 200 people feel like he is personally sorry to each of them.
        He has done this for three Fortune 500 companies. He cannot say which ones. He signed NDAs.
        He is sorry about the NDAs.</p>

    <div class="methodology" id="method">
      <h2>The Marek Method™</h2>
      <p>Developed over 2,300 apologies. Peer-reviewed by Gerald's mother, who says it
      "works on her, at least."</p>
      <div class="steps">
        <div class="step-card">
          <div class="num">STEP 01</div>
          <h3>The Arrival</h3>
          <p>Gerald arrives exactly three minutes early. Not five — that's eager. Not on time —
          that's casual. Three minutes says: "I have been thinking about this."</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-card">
          <div class="num">STEP 02</div>
          <h3>The Posture</h3>
          <p>Shoulders slightly forward. Hands visible at all times. Head tilted 7 degrees to the
          left. Gerald measured this. Seven degrees communicates remorse without appearing injured.
          Eight degrees is pity. Six is indifference. Seven is sorry.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-card">
          <div class="num">STEP 03</div>
          <h3>The Words</h3>
          <p>Gerald never says "I'm sorry you feel that way." He says "I'm sorry." Then he stops
          talking. The silence does more work than any sentence. Gerald once held a silence for
          forty-one seconds. The recipient forgave a fourteen-year grudge. Gerald counts this as
          his masterpiece.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="step-card">
          <div class="num">STEP 04</div>
          <h3>The Exit</h3>
          <p>Gerald leaves before it gets comfortable. "You don't stay for coffee," Gerald says.
          "You're not there to be liked. You're there to be believed." He puts on his coat slowly.
          He nods once. He closes the door quietly. Several clients have described this as
          "cinematic."</p>

          <h3>The Henderson Thanksgiving (2022)</h3>
          <p>Client said something about his sister's divorce "as a joke" at Thanksgiving dinner.
          The sister left. Two aunts cried. The client's mother called it "the worst thing anyone
          has ever done at this table, and your uncle once brought a parrot." Gerald was dispatched
          to the sister's apartment the following Tuesday. He brought flowers ($44) and a handwritten
          note on the client's behalf (the client cannot write cursive — Gerald can). The sister
          forgave the client by Wednesday. She has not, however, forgiven the uncle about the parrot.
          Gerald has offered his services. The uncle declined.</p>

          <h3>The Wrong Wedding (2023)</h3>
          <p>Gerald was hired to apologize to a bride's father for a toast gone wrong. Due to a
          venue mix-up, Gerald arrived at the wrong wedding and delivered the apology to the wrong
          father. The father — who had not been owed an apology by anyone — broke down crying and
          said, "I've been waiting twelve years for someone to say that." Gerald, confused but
          committed, continued. He resolved a family rift he had no knowledge of. He considers
          this his greatest professional achievement and his most serious ethical violation.
          He thinks about it every night.</p>

          <h3>The Parking Dispute (2024)</h3>
          <p>Client backed into a neighbor's mailbox for the third time. Gerald arrived with
          flowers and the seven-degree head tilt. The neighbor said, "Tell him to learn how to
          drive." Gerald attempted the forty-one-second silence. The neighbor closed the door at
          second nineteen. Gerald stood on the porch for the remaining twenty-two seconds anyway.
          He left the flowers. They were not brought inside. This is case #47 in the 3%. Gerald
          has driven past the house twice since then. The mailbox has been replaced. The flowers
          are gone. He does not know if this means anything.</p>

    <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 1 ? null : 1">
      <h3>Is Gerald actually sorry?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 1">Yes. Gerald experiences genuine sorrow during every apology. He
      does not fake it. He says he "connects with the universal human experience of having done
      something wrong" and channels it. His therapist calls this "unsustainable." Gerald calls
      it "the job." He has been seeing the therapist since 2021. He apologized to her once for
      being a difficult patient. She said it was "the best apology she'd ever received" and then
      reminded him that their relationship is professional. Gerald thinks about this often.</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 2 ? null : 2">
      <h3>What if the person doesn't forgive?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 2">This has happened 69 times out of 2,300 apologies. Gerald
      maintains a file on each one. The file is in a drawer in his office labeled "OPEN." He
      revisits them quarterly. Twice, he has returned to the recipient months later, unpaid,
      and tried again. One of those times, it worked. The other time, the person had moved.
      Gerald left the flowers on the porch of the new occupant, who was confused but
      reportedly said, "That was nice, I think."</p>
    </div>

    <div class="faq-item" x-on:click="open = open === 3 ? null : 3">
      <h3>Can Gerald apologize for something I haven't done yet?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 3">Gerald has been asked this four times. His answer is always:
      "That's not an apology. That's a warning." He does, however, offer a Pre-Emptive
      Consultation ($150) where he helps you understand the emotional impact of what you're
      about to do and decides whether to take you on as a future client. He has talked three
      people out of doing the thing. He does not charge for this. He considers it "preventive
      care."</p>

      <h3>Why only one suit?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 4">Gerald owns two suits. The regular suit (charcoal, Brooks Brothers,
      purchased 2019) and the wedding suit (navy, also Brooks Brothers, purchased 2022). He wears
      no other clothing professionally. He says the suit "removes Gerald from the equation" and
      allows the recipient to see "pure apology, uncontaminated by personality." His mother says
      he looks very handsome in both suits. Gerald has framed this compliment. It is on his desk
      next to his CPA certification (Certified Professional Apologizer — self-issued, not
      recognized by any governing body).</p>

      <h3>Does Gerald ever apologize for himself?</h3>
      <p x-show="open === 5">Gerald does not make mistakes. This is not arrogance. Gerald has
      simply organized his life to minimize the possibility of wrongdoing. He arrives early. He
      remembers birthdays. He calls his mother every Sunday. He has never once been late to an
      apology. He did, however, once step on a client's cat during an in-home visit. He
      apologized to the cat directly. The cat accepted. Gerald counts this among his professional
      statistics. His forgiveness rate would be 96.97% without the cat. With the cat, it is 97%.
      Gerald is grateful to the cat.</p>
