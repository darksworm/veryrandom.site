      <div class="minute-item">
        <div class="time">7:02 PM</div>
        <strong>Carol</strong> calls meeting to order. Notes that she had to park on Birch Street
        because the library lot was full. "This is exactly what I'm talking about."
        <strong>Tom</strong> suggests that if fewer people drove, the lot wouldn't be full.
        Carol tables the discussion.
      </div>

      <div class="minute-item">
        <div class="time">7:08 PM</div>
        <strong>Debra</strong> presents updated farmers market proposal (v.14). Includes a
        map, vendor applications, and a suggested candle booth in the center ("for ambiance").
        <strong>Frank</strong> asks if Margherita's would be allowed a booth. Debra says
        all local businesses are welcome. Frank says "then what's the point."
      </div>

      <div class="minute-item">
        <div class="time">7:19 PM</div>
        <strong>Nina</strong> proposes that any new public space include a water fountain
        "for residents and their companions." <strong>Raj</strong> asks if the fountain could
        be a quiet model. Nina says she'll look into it. <strong>Tom</strong> says the space
        should be car-free. <strong>Carol</strong> says "let's not get ahead of ourselves."
      </div>

      <div class="minute-item">
        <div class="time">7:31 PM</div>
        <strong>Frank</strong> asks the board to consider the "Margherita's question." He
        presents a chart showing correlation between the restaurant's opening and a rise in
        "general dissatisfaction." <strong>Owen</strong> asks what data the chart is based on.
        Frank says "the feeling around town." Owen says "okay cool."
      </div>

      <div class="minute-item">
        <div class="time">7:44 PM</div>
        <strong>Tom</strong> presents a 22-slide deck titled "Millbrook 2030: A Bikeable Future."
        Slide 7 includes a rendering of Main Street with no cars. Carol asks him to skip to
        the summary. Tom says every slide is the summary. Carol lets him continue.
        <strong>Raj</strong> notes that bicycles are "essentially silent" and expresses
        rare enthusiasm.
      </div>

      <div class="minute-item">

        <div>
          <h3>Successfully Petitioned to Extend Library Hours</h3>
          <p>After a six-month campaign, the library now closes at 8 PM instead of 7 PM on
          Thursdays. Carol was in favor (more time to park). Tom was in favor (evening bike access).
          Raj was against (noise). Raj was outvoted but appreciated that the meeting about it
          ended early.</p>

          <h3>Community Cleanup Day</h3>
          <p>27 volunteers picked up litter along Elm Street and Maple Avenue. Nina brought all
          four dogs. Pretzel ate a glove. Frank spent the entire event standing outside
          Margherita's, picking up litter "within a very specific radius." Owen showed up
          two hours late but stayed an extra hour to compensate. Debra handed out candle
          samples. Three volunteers later reported headaches.</p>

          <h3>Town Hall Presentation</h3>
          <p>The committee presented a unified vision for Millbrook's future to the Town Council.
          The presentation included Carol's parking study, Tom's bike lane renderings, Debra's
          market plans, Nina's green space proposal, and Frank's Margherita's chart. The Council
          thanked the committee and said they would "take it under advisement." Nothing has been
          advised since. The committee considers this a win.</p>

          <h3>Installed a Bench</h3>
          <p>After eighteen months of deliberation, the committee installed a bench on the corner
          of Main and Oak. The bench faces east. Carol wanted it facing the parking lot. Tom
          wanted it facing the (hypothetical) bike lane. Nina wanted it near the grass. Frank
          wanted it facing away from Margherita's. The final orientation was a compromise that
          faces a brick wall. Raj said he appreciates that the bench "doesn't make any noise."
          Owen painted it. He chose teal. Nobody asked for teal.</p>

    <h2>From the Newsletter</h2>
    <div class="newsletter">
      <h3>Chair's Corner — February 2025</h3>
      <p>Dear neighbors,</p>
      <p>As we enter our fourth year, I am proud to say the Millbrook Betterment Committee
      is stronger than ever. Our board represents the full spectrum of what makes Millbrook
      great — passion, dedication, and a willingness to show up on the second Thursday of
      every month, even when the library's parking lot is, once again, completely full.</p>
      <p>This month we passed an important resolution affirming our commitment to improvement.
      While the specifics are still being discussed, the spirit of the resolution is clear:
      Millbrook can do better. We all agree on this. We have always agreed on this. What
      "better" means is, of course, something we will continue to explore together, as a
      committee, in the months and years ahead.</p>
      <p>On a personal note, I want to acknowledge Frank, who has shown incredible dedication
      to his ongoing research into what he calls "the Elm Street question." While the board has
      not formally adopted his findings, we respect his commitment to the investigative process.</p>
      <p>See you on the 14th. Please carpool if possible. Not because of the environment —
      because of the parking.</p>
      <div class="sign-off">
        — Carol Pemberton, Chair<br>
        "Betterment begins with showing up. And finding a spot."

          <p>Millbrook Public Library, Room B. Agenda items include: Debra's farmers market
          proposal (v.15), Tom's revised bike lane presentation (now 31 slides), and continued
          discussion of the bench. Nina will bring Biscuit. Raj has pre-filed a noise concern.</p>

          <p>A guided walk through downtown Millbrook to "identify areas for improvement."
          Route planned by Tom (avoids all roads). Alternate route planned by Carol (avoids
          all hills). Nina has requested that dogs be permitted. Frank has requested that the
          walk not pass Margherita's. Both requests have been accommodated, leaving a route
          that is approximately one block long.</p>

          <p>Location TBD. Last year's picnic was held in the library parking lot after the
          park was rejected (Nina: "not enough shade for the dogs"), the town square was
          rejected (Frank: "too close to Margherita's"), and the school field was rejected
          (Raj: "the church bells"). Owen has volunteered to DJ. He has not been asked to DJ.
          He has purchased speakers.</p>
