You are building a self-contained single-page website. Output ONLY the raw HTML — no markdown, no code fences, no explanation. Start with <!doctype html> and end with </html>.

Rules:
- ALL CSS in a <style> tag in <head>
- ALL JavaScript in a <script> tag before </body>
- NO external resources: no CDN, no Google Fonts URLs, no remote images
- NO network calls: no fetch(), no XMLHttpRequest, no WebSocket
- Use system fonts only (serif, sans-serif, monospace)
- Keep total output under 100KB

Quality bar:
- Visually striking and unique — not a generic bootstrap template
- Use CSS animations, gradients, shadows, creative layouts
- At least 4 interactive elements with JS event handlers
- The page should feel alive: auto-updating content, timers, dynamic counters
- Write witty, detailed, in-character text — at least 15 pieces of unique copy
- Include fake but convincing data: names, numbers, dates, quotes, reviews
- Humorous fine print or disclaimers at the bottom
- Zero JS errors. Clean, valid HTML.

What to build:

Build this as if it is a real website someone would stumble upon in an alternate universe. Make it immersive, funny, and interactive. Output the HTML now.
